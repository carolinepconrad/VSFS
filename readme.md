### Description
This VSFS describes each component of a simple file system and then demonstrates how each of the parts work interact and work together. An example using a simple txt file containing the word "Hello" is used. For simplicity, 4kb is used as each blocks storage capacity, and the file being saved is also 4kb. The file is used to demonstrate each of the components as well as the interaction between each parts.
